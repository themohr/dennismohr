<h1>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</h1>
<p>Authoring Web pages begins with Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). On the outset it seems extremely simple and really, anyone can do it.  Today's landscape requires thoughtful markup to handle the continual growth in devices and environments.  HTML5 offers improved specs for form handling, audio/video presentation, and improved semantics.  Browser support still presents issues for Web development requiring ongoing maintenance for old development environments.</p>
<h2>Specs & Standards</h2>
<p>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) maintains specifications for HTML and promotes standards based Web development for improved user experience and development.  In the world of computer programming, scalable code is a major factor in order to improve software more effectively.  The World Wide Web (www, or Web) often lacks this feature.  The flexibility of HTML allows for adding design and functionality without structure or standards.</p>
<h2>Goal</h2>
<p>Many great resources exist to learn HTML and those resources are quite good at describing a way to develop Web sites with structure.  In many cases there is no need to deviate from those methods, however, in team environments, many issues become compounded by lack of planning for team code.  More recent thinking in Web dev circles demonstrates a movement toward object oriented authoring and guides in addition to frameworks.  Much of the work involved requires combined coding in CSS and Javascript.</p>
