<h1>DM = Dennis Mohr</h1>
<p>
I know, it's real clever!  Sometimes it's too easy to out-think our intuition looking for the next great logo, name or brand.  Here, I just want to give a little background to DM (studio?).

<h2>Modus Operandi</h2>
<p>
On a typical about us page you might see a modus operandi (MO) and a recipe for results with a closing, "Why pick me..." statement.  So here it is, and then on to the interesting stuff.  I deliver quality Web experiences using open source back-end technology via PHP and MySQL primarily.  I like to create concise HTML, CSS and Javascript to the client side and make sure the user gets exactly what s/he is looking for.  I thouroughly enjoy Web development and I will make sure to set up marketing for search engines and social media to get traffic and increase your selling potential.

<h2>Time for fun?</h2>
<p>
More about me?  I enjoy the outdoors for fishing and bike riding.  Football and baseball are good fun and recently I've found basketball intriguing.  I like what I do for work but I prefer to be with my family.  A cup of coffee in the morning and a brew in the afternoon usually complete my day.  I honor the good Lord Jesus Christ for the gift of life and aim to serve Him in all that I do.
