<h1>Scaleable, Modular Web Development</h1>
            <p>One of the biggest challenges Web developers face is the rapid change in technology. Languages gain new specifications including HTML5 and CSS3.  Frameworks, libraries, and browsers develop and change in regular increments meaning we must keep a watchful eye in the vast landscape.  An additional problem I've experienced in more recent years is a self-induced problem that stems from "best practices" in Web development. A quick look at the source code of a Web page reveals the use of ID's and deep selectors to style navigation, carousels, sidebars, footers and everything in between.  It spurred me on recently to discover an alternative way of thinking about frontend markup and code in general.</p>
        	<h1>Web Development: Frontend/Backend</h1>
            <p>The path to defining my working life resembles a rollercoaster, downtown one-way streets, and a bit of mountain pass driving.  I'll spare the details in full, but the list includes retail, construction, restaurants and big box. Nine years ago my occupation became Web development.  That's what this site is all about.  A look at the past, present and future of Web development.</p>
            <p>My experience includes both frontend and backend development.  The bulk of my work includes setting up server side code to out put frontend markup.  On the frontend I work with the usual technology, HTML/CSS/Javascript.  Server knowledge includes Apache and IIS with an introduction to Tomcat.  I like open source langues and work with PHP/MySQL, however, I also use Coldfusion.  Finally, I have a sprinkling of knowledge in Java and JSP.
